# Checkbox

Checkboxes can be used to provide a user with a binary choice, for example, toggling email notifications on and off.

## Best practices

- When changing a setting, checkboxes should always be accompanied with a label.
- Labels should be descriptive enough, that they can stand up on their own. For example: 'Enable email notifications' is better than 'Enable/Disable'.
