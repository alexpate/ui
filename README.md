## Important
When this repo is published to NPM, our fonts don't get published for licensing reasons. It currently falls back to the font files that exist in the `lystable-frontend` repo.

## Getting Started
This repo is bundled with React Storybook, an application that allows you to view components in isolation.

First install dependencies and setup environment:

```
npm install
```

And then to run it locally:

```
npm run storybook
```
