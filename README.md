# Kalo UI üçÉ

![@kalo/ui](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@kalo/ui.svg)

---

An assortment of low-level components pulled from lystable-frontend. This repo contains the source code, and a development environment to develop new components in.

## Getting Started
This repo is bundled with React Storybook, an application that allows you to view components in isolation.

First install dependencies and setup environment:

```
npm install
npm run storybook
```
You should now have Storybook running at [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060)!

## Using the components
Example: to import a button from the library in your application:

```javascript
import {Button} from '@kalo/ui';
```

## Publishing a new version
To publish a new version:

1. Ensure you have been added to the Kalo NPM organisation
2. Increase the version in `package.json`
3. `npm run dist`
4. `cd lib` and `npm publish`

*Publish from the lib folder to ensure that the module is published in a flat file structure.*

#### Notes
When this repo is published to NPM, our fonts don't get published for licensing reasons. It currently falls back to the font files that exist in the `lystable-frontend` repo.
